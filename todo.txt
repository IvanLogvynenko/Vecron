- Shell
-- make a shell wrapper to exec several commands in one shell
-- make unrestricted shell (resticted by default)
-- create a shell input filtering, because default restricted shell is too restrictive
-- if unrestricted shell started then notify user if "allow_unrestricted_shell" is not set 
-- try to run in restricted shell if "allow_unrestricted_shell" is set to false
-- add "warn_unrestricted_shell" option to warn user if unrestricted shell is used in case "allow_unrestricted_shell" is true
